# Dog Breed Classifier

In this project, I have made a dog breed classifier using deep learning. This uses PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks for preprocessing and training the model.
I have used transfer learning by adding few more layers to an already pre-trained model VGG-16, this model has been trained on over millions of images to help me with this.

Hope you like it!
